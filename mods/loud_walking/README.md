# loud_walking

Loud Walking is a play on the name of an old science fiction movie about an attempt to preserve Earth's endangered life in sealed pods in space. This mod creates pods with more or less normal terrain inside, including vegetation and minerals. Eventually they'll have a variety of biomes inside. It's unusual in being fully three-dimensional. There are pods above, pods below, pods to all sides, and they all work basically the same. Bridges are provided to move horizontally. Moving vertically is more challenging.
